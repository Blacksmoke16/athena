# Athena
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Blacksmoke16/athena.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Blacksmoke16/athena)

Modular annotation based web framework with built in param conversion inspired by [Symfony Routing](https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html).

## Goals

- Extensible and customizable to fit all use cases.
- Be easy to adopt and start using effectively.
- Remove unneeded boilerplate code to convert route/body params to correct type.
- Easy serialization via [CrSerializer](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/CrSerializer).
- Decrease bloat.  Only include what you need.

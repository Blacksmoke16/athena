# Documentation

Athena takes a modular approach to its feature set.  Each feature is encapsulated in its own module; and can be required independently of each other.  This allows an application to only include what that application needs, without extra bloat.

## The `athena` executable

Upon install, Athena will build and add an `athena`Â executable to your projects `bin` directory.  This binary can be used to run Athena related commands, all of which are listed in the [docs](<https://blacksmoke16.github.io/athena/Athena/Commands.html>).
